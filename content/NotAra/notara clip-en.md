Since I am preoccupied with other projects, and having hard time finding quality time to work on NotAra, I am going to keep it, as much as possible, simple. There is going to be two types of capture method: Highlighting and clipping. For now only PDF files can be shown. Using html rendering power of Qt, displaying formats such as html and epub is also planned.

Highlighted and clipped areas are shown as orange in the image, while selections are blue. It will be possible to attach tags and notes to clips, and search them. Currently these are just cosmetic, and backend will be written when I had enough motivation to do so. Application will provide a single access point to all notes with a simple interface.
