It seems my attempts on writing an UI library for my homebrew game is more time consuming than I deemed. Considering game will also be available for mobile platforms, I have chosen an enginethat can already be compiled to these platforms and solved the problems I am trying to solve (scripting, events). An that engine is [Minko](http://minko.io/engine/#about). Here is current state with Minko.
