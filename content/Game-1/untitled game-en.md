A game project that I had in mind for some time. Even though I had decided to write this game more than six months ago, only previous week I could finally start working on it. It is based on a 2 years old WebGL trial of mine. I have already planned basic gameplay, however overall design is going to be shaped after discussion sessions with the artist (Hasan).

Here is the first video. Floating rectangular boxes will be sources of power where wizards (player and AI) from all over the world compete over.

Game is using awesome [Horde3D](http://www.horde3d.org/) to render its primitives. I am generating the earth by subdividing then truncating an icosahedron. Colors are from surface normals.
