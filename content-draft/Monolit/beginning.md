I am trying to build a simple game engine (codenamed **Monolit**) which will target both Android and Desktops. Today I have made the first commit to the [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository on Dropbox and started blogging with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/).

It is going to be written in C++. My build system will be [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) for desktops and I am planning to cross-compile on all platforms targeted using [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) toolchain, including Android. In this long journey let the mighty [vim](http://www.vim.org/) equipped with the [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) consort me.
